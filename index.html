                <h2>Hi, I'm Erica!</h2>
                <p> I'm a student at Wilfrid Laurier University pursuing a bachelor's degree in User Experience Design. <br>
                    As a design students, I'm always open and interested in learning new approaches/perspectives to <br>things
                    such as user-centred research methods and tools. I love how design can spark conversations<br> and
                     meaningful messages to connect communities and cultures.â€‹ While pursuing my user experience <br>degree at Laurier,
                    I've had numerous opportunities to meet and work with amazing people who have <br>taught me a lot of new
                and valuable skills. Working in teams had definitely broadened my understanding <br>of the world of UX.</p>

            <h3>Study Lock</h3>
            <p> Due to COVID-19, students have been struggling to focus and complete their tasks on time.<br> 
                For this Reason, "Study Lock" is a great app that can strongly benefit students through<br>
            these tough times. Personally, I have been procrastinating a lot, and I think this app would<br>
            would be a great resource for me to stay on top of my things and be more organized. For instance<br>
            students can start a timer and set the duration according to how long they want to study for. Once<br> the
            timer is activated, their phones will be fully locked until the timer goes off which will give<br> students less 
            of an urge to go on their phones.</p>
            <img src="img4.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Cardboard Boxes</h3>
            <p> For this project, my group thought of a way to effectively reuse large cardboard boxes since
                they are usually<br> discarded after we unbox our package. We came up with a great idea to reuse
                cardboard boxes and turn it<br> into a creative project, something that children can play with. To do so,
                each cardboard box will come <br>with a QR code, and by scanning it, users will obtain a instruction guide on 
                how to successfully build <br>the box. Children can put their hands-on ability to the test and this 
                also serves as a great chance for <br>children to strengthen their bonds with their parents since it they can work on it together.</p> 
            <img src="img6.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>UX Through Tiktok</h3>
            <p> The UX industry has been growing drastically over the years, and more people are curious with what you can<br> 
                do with it. This app is quick and easy to use, making it ideal for users who are new to user experience and want <br>to learn more about it.
            This app will cover a ton of UX topics such as the courses needed, their responsibilities, <br>their day to day life,
            and their salary. Tiktok is such a big platform and more convenient for people from<br> around the world to see the potentials of UX.
        Overall, our project will solve the hassle of researching about<br> this career, therefore, making it easier for people who are seeking opportunities 
    or want to gain more <br>knowledge about this field.</p>

            <h3>Artista</h3>
            <p> For this project, my group created "Artista", an app that we made for amateur artists to plan their performances<br>
            in a convenient way. Artists/musicians can easily reach out to other artists to collab, and reach out to agents for<br>
            assistance. Not only will it create a profile for you, but it also will provide you suggestions with different types<br> 
            of performances that you can choose from. Overall, this app is very useful and convenient for artists to reach out <br>to
            each other since they can view each others profiles beforehand and determine whether or not they are a good fit.
